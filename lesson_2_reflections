REFLECT: INITIALIZING A REPOSITORY

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

ANSWER: You create a hidden directory (.directory) where metadata which
users don't need to interact with; this directory helps users storing the 
files git need to work with.

REFLECT: STAGING AREA

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is in a middle position, it works like an intermediary
between the directory and the repository. It offers the value of including
new files to the repository and leaving other files untracked.
