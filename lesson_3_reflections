Reflect: Using a remote repository

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
you work local?

A:When you want other people to easily access your repository for
editing, add files or made their own version of your proyect from
your repository.

Reflect: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To maintain your own version of the repository as you wish. Other 
people can also be collaborating in the same proyect, and you don't
want their changes to mix up with your work.
